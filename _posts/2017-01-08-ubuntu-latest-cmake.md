这篇文章记录了在 Linux 上安装最新版本的 CMake 的过程。




## 软件环境

OS：Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS (Xenial Xerus)

SW：CMake 3.7.2

## 卸载之前安装的 CMake

假如你之前已经安装了 CMake，但不是最新版本，你可以先卸载它。

在 Ubuntu 上，可以用以下命令卸载 CMake：

```shell
sudo apt-get purge cmake
```

## 下载最新版本的 CMake

通常我会认为你所谓的最新版本，应该是最新稳定版。截止到今天为止，目前 CMake 的最新稳定版（Latest Release）版本号是：3.7.2

在 CMake 官方网站的下载页，可以找到当前 CMake 的下载地址。Latest Release (3.7.2) 的 Linux 版是：[cmake-3.7.2.tar.gz](https://cmake.org/files/v3.7/cmake-3.7.2.tar.gz)

将它下载下来以后，解压这个压缩包：

```shell
mkdir ~/tmp
cd ~/tmp/
wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.7/cmake-3.7.2.tar.gz
tar xzvf cmake-3.7.2.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.7.2/
```

## 安装 CMake

```shell
./bootstrap
```

执行这个命令的时间略长，会执行一个长长的 check，到最后提示说可以运行 make 了：

```shell
-o cmake
